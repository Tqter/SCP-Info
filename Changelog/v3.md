## The Future of SCP Info

As you may know, SCP Info has been in the works for a while now. With the new Discord features and the cancellation of discord.py development we have come to an issue. We could keep developing and deal with discord's very odd development, or we could stop/slow down the development of SCP Info. So what I have decided is to cease development of SCP Info temporarily. We might come back, and we might not. What I do know is that the bot will still be running up until at least April 2022. After that things might go downhill. We hope to see you keep using the bot :).
